## 🛠 Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Plan the Architecture**
   - Decide if it's client-side, server-side, or both
   - Design the message protocol for networking
   - Consider performance implications

2. **Implement Server Logic**
   - Add new message types to `server/main.py`
   - Update the `GameServer` class with new methods
   - Test with multiple clients

3. **Update Client Code**
   - Add UI elements to `client/index.html`
   - Implement client-side logic in `client/js/game.js`
   - Handle new server messages

4. **Document Changes**
   - Update `docs/API.md` with new message types
   - Add examples to documentation
   - Update README if needed

```

### Performance Considerations

**Server Optimization**
- Use asyncio for concurrent connections
- Implement spatial partitioning for large worlds
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize message serialization

**Client Optimization**  
- Use object pooling for entities
- Implement level-of-detail (LOD) for distant objects
- Optimize render calls with frustum culling
- Use web workers for heavy computations
