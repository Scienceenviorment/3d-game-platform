## 🛠️ **Advanced Options (If Needed)**

### **Python Game Engines (Upgrade Paths)**
```python
# Panda3D - Full 3D engine with Python
pip install panda3d
# Pros: Complete 3D, Python-native, free
# Cons: Learning curve, larger download

# Pygame - 2D focused, simple
pip install pygame  
# Pros: Very simple, lots of tutorials
# Cons: Limited 3D capabilities

# Godot + Python - Powerful editor
# Pros: Visual editor, GDScript similar to Python
# Cons: Separate download, more complex setup
```

### **Database Options (Future Expansion)**
```python
# SQLite - Built into Python, no setup needed
import sqlite3
# Pros: Zero setup, good performance
# Cons: Single file, limited concurrent users

# JSON - What we currently use
import json
# Pros: Human readable, simple, no setup
# Cons: Not as fast for large datasets

# PostgreSQL/MySQL - Production databases
# Pros: High performance, multi-user
# Cons: Complex setup, external dependencies
```

### **Graphics Enhancement (Optional)**
```python
# Blender Python API - Procedural assets
import bpy
# Pros: Powerful 3D modeling, Python scripting
# Cons: Requires Blender installation

# Shader Programming - Advanced effects  
# HLSL (DirectX) or GLSL (OpenGL)
# Pros: Beautiful graphics, modern effects
# Cons: Requires graphics programming knowledge
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Made Simple**

### **Common Issues & Quick Fixes**

**"Python not found"**
```bash
# Download Python from python.org
# Make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation
```

**"Module not found"**
```bash
# Our installer handles this automatically
python simple_setup.py install
```

**"Port already in use"**
```bash
# Change port in simple_game_server.py
PORT = 8001  # Instead of 8000
```

**"Can't connect to game"**
```bash
# 1. Check server is running (green text in console)
# 2. Open simple_web_client.html in browser
# 3. Make sure WebSocket connects (check browser console F12)
```
